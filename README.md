Relationship between Common Health Factors & Lifestyle Choices and Drug Overdose Mortality Rates on a County Level

## Rural vs Urban Defintion
Based on the US Census Bureau, they use the following defition for the County Percent Rural that we have access to. Specifically, " Completely rural counties have a population that is 100 percent rural. Mostly rural counties have a population that is 50.0â€“99.9 percent rural. Mostly urban counties have a population that is less than 50.0 percent rural." (https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/ua/Defining_Rural.pdf)
